## Javascript Random Equation Game

**Project description:** This project generates a random math equation (addition/subtraction/multiplication/division) and checks the answer and awards a point if correct. You can skip a question at no cost, but incorrect answers lose 1 point. You can save under a name, and the current question and score will get saved to local storage under that name.
